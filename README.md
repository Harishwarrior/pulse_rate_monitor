## How to use it
First place your finger on the device so that it covers both the flash and the camera. The flash should turn on during the measurement. Try to keep your finger as stable as possible because even small movements will disrupt the measurement. The BPM reading should be accurate when the graph looks stable as shown in the screenshot above.
